Two input files for catechol on the anatase (101) surface. The bind file is for dynamics and the in file is 
for cubebuilder2.

To run dynamics type:

$ dynamics catechol_anatase101.bind

This should produce several files; .out .status .edyn .edyn.wave.
The .out and .status files are the yaehmop output files.
The .edyn has the survival amplitude and occupation output.
The .edyn.wave file is used for creating Gaussian format cube files.



To run cubebuilder type:

$ cubebuilder2 catechol_anatase.in catechol_anatase101.bind.edyn.wave

This should produce a number of cube files that can be visualized with either 
Molekel or VMD.
